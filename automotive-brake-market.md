<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc Brakes</li><li>Drum Brakes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive brake market primarily includes disc brakes and drum brakes. Disc brakes use calipers to squeeze brake pads against a rotor, offering superior stopping power, heat dissipation, and performance, making them ideal for front wheels and high-speed vehicles. Drum brakes, on the other hand, use brake shoes that press against the inner surface of a drum, providing cost-effectiveness and durability, often used in rear wheels of smaller or budget vehicles. Both systems are essential for vehicle safety and performance.</p></p>
