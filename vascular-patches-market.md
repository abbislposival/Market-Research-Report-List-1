<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vascular Patches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biologic Vascular Patches</li><li>Synthetic Vascular Patches</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vascular patches market is primarily divided into two types: biologic vascular patches and synthetic vascular patches. Biologic vascular patches are made from natural materials, often derived from human or animal tissue, offering good biocompatibility and promoting healing. Synthetic vascular patches, on the other hand, are created from artificial materials like polyester or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), providing durability and ease of manufacturing. Both types are used in vascular surgeries to repair or reinforce blood vessels, each with unique advantages and applications.</p></p>
