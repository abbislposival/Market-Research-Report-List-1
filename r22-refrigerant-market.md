<p><strong>What Are The Key Opportunities For R22 Refrigerant Manufacturers?</strong></p>
<p><p>The R22 refrigerant market has experienced significant fluctuations due to regulatory pressures and the phase-out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) under the Montreal Protocol. As of 2023, demand continues to decline, driven by the shift to more eco-friendly alternatives such as R410A and R32. Growth trends indicate an increasing preference for low-GWP refrigerants in residential and commercial applications. The market is expected to contract further as supply diminishes and alternative refrigerants gain market share. Future outlook points towards a complete phase-out by 2025, urging stakeholders to innovate and adapt to sustainable refrigerant technologies to meet environmental standards.</p></p>
