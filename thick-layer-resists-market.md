<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thick Layer Resists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Resists</li><li>Negative Resists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thick layer resists are specialized materials used in photolithography processes, primarily in microfabrication and semiconductor industries. The market is segmented into positive and negative resists. Positive resists undergo chemical changes upon exposure to light, resulting in the removal of exposed areas, making them ideal for high-resolution applications. In contrast, negative resists harden upon exposure, and the unexposed regions are washed away, suitable for applications requiring robust structural integrity. Both types cater to distinct user needs in advanced manufacturing processes.</p></p>
