<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endotracheal Suctioning Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed System</li><li>Open System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Endotracheal suctioning devices are essential for maintaining airway clearance in patients with respiratory issues. The market is primarily divided into two types: closed systems and open systems. Closed systems allow continuous ventilation while providing suctioning through a sterile catheter encased in a protective sheath, reducing infection risk. Open systems involve using a separate catheter inserted into the airway, requiring disconnection from the ventilator, which poses a higher infection risk. Each system has distinct applications based on patient needs and healthcare settings.</p></p>
