<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Glasses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophobic Coating</li><li>Hydrophilic Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-cleaning glasses market features two main types of coatings: hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Hydrophobic coatings repel water, causing it to bead and roll off, effectively carrying dirt and grime with it. This results in a cleaner surface with minimal maintenance. Hydrophilic coatings, on the other hand, attract water, creating a thin film that spreads evenly over the surface, facilitating the removal of dirt through rinsing. Both technologies enhance the cleanliness and durability of glass surfaces, ideal for various applications.</p></p>
