<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DR Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect FPD</li><li>Direct FPD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital radiography flat panel detector (FPD) market is primarily divided into two types: indirect and direct FPDs. Indirect FPDs convert X-rays into light, which is then transformed into an electrical signal, utilizing a scintillator layer. These detectors are often known for their cost-effectiveness and image quality. Conversely, direct FPDs convert X-rays directly into an electrical signal using photoconductive materials, offering enhanced image resolution and faster image capture. Both types serve distinct applications in medical imaging, catering to varying needs in healthcare settings.</p></p>
