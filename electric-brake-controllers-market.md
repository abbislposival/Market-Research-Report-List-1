<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Brake Controllers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Proportional Brake Controllers</li><li>Time-Delayed Brake Controllers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric brake controllers are essential for safely managing trailer braking systems. Proportional brake controllers adjust braking power in real-time based on the vehicle's deceleration, providing a smooth and responsive stopping experience. They offer better control and reduce wear on both the vehicle and trailer brakes. In contrast, time-delayed brake controllers apply brakes after a predetermined time delay, leading to a more gradual stop. While easier to install, they may not offer the same responsiveness as proportional models, impacting overall safety.</p></p>
