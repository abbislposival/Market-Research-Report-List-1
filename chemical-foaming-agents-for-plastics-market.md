<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Foaming Agents for Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endothermic Foaming Agent</li><li>Compound Foaming Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chemical foaming agents for plastics are substances that produce gas when heated or chemically reacted, creating a cellular structure in the plastic material. Endothermic foaming agents absorb heat during their reaction, resulting in gas generation while lowering the material's temperature, enhancing foam stability. Compound foaming agents, on the other hand, involve a mixture of different substances that release gas upon thermal decomposition, providing flexibility in foam properties. Both types play crucial roles in reducing density and improving insulation in plastic applications.</p></p>
